# Notes

## Transform
There are 4 properties to transform objects in our scene
```
position (to move the object)
scale (to resize the object)
rotation (to rotate the object)
quaternion (to also rotate the object; more about that later)
All classes that inherit from the Object3D class possess those properties like PerspectiveCamera or Mesh and classes that we haven't covered yet.
```
